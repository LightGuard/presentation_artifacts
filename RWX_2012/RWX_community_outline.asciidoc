== This Presentation ==

* Discussion
  ** Not a typical lecture, I want this to be interactive
  ** Feel free to ask questions whenever
  ** Probably use the flip paper
  ** Do my best to write legibly
  ** Share experiences
* New ideas
  ** I hope this sparks new ideas for all of us
  ** Please share as they come
* Application in a standard work place
  ** Why should this only be applied to OSS?

== A little about you ==

* Who is involved in an OSS community?
* Who wants to be involved in an OSS community?
* Who thinks this is applicable to regular workplace?

== Case Studies ==

=== Seam 3 ===

* Started early 2009
* lulled for about a year
* EXPLODED late 2010 / early 2011 - 19 modules
  ** Moved to GitHub
  ** 19 modules
  ** Around 26 active contributors
    *** World wide -- USA, UK, Eastern & Western Europe, Australia, 
  ** I joined in October 2010
* Ultimately grow too fast, we weren't prepared
  ** Also had competing initiatives among core developers (Forge, Arquillian, 
     RichFaces, etc)

=== Arquillian ===

* Initially started as CDI test suite around 2008 / 2009
* 106 contributors (various levels of activity)
  ** Actually out of date now 113 (yesterday)
  ** World wide -- USA, UK, Eastern and Western Europe, China, India, 
     Australia, Japan, Brazil, Canada
* More than 50 modules
* Major exposure through Seam 3, JavaOne, Devoxx etc.
* Still growing and thriving
  ** New things being added all the time, new module / feature added just two 
     weeks ago at Devoxx

=== Forge ===

* Started late 2010
* 26 modules / plugins
  ** Mostly focused on Java EE capabilities, some Spring,
     also scaffolding
* ~ 40 contributors (various levels of activity) 
  ** USA, Eastern & Western Europe, South America, Norway

== Factors that motivate people to join a project ==

=== Solve a problem ===

* We're using project X and we found a bug, here's a patch
  ** Probably the most common
  ** Can be fleeting
  ** Any kind of bug -- code, docs, build, etc.
  ** Also doesn't always result in a patch
* We have a feature and can't keep patching releases,
  here's a new feature you can add
  ** Probably the easiest kinds of contributors to pull in
    ** Already familiar with the build, the code, etc.  

=== Working with Others on the Project ===

==== Working with idols ====

* I really like Jill Programmer, I think he rocks! I want to work with him
  ** This is a large part of my motivation 

==== Working with old friends ====

* Hey, I remember Jeff! It's been a while but it looks like he has a new
  project he's working on. I'd like to work with him again.
  ** Lots of people start creating OSS projects, you never know what 
     you'll find

=== Exposure ===

==== Resume ====

* OSS always looks good on a resume
  ** Rails
  ** Hibernate
  ** grails
  ** NoSQL
  ** Apache projects
* Often buzzwords employers / recruiters seek

==== Landing a job ====

* Working for a company doing OSS: Red Hat, IBM, VMWare, etc
* Examples from Seam / Forge (Brian, Me, George, Gunnar, Ken, etc)

=== Growing skills ===

* Working in a distributed team
  ** Certainly different challenges here
  ** Often better communication skills developed
  ** Motivation
* Learning about a technology (specs, technology group, etc)
  ** New ways of solving problems
  ** Different problems to solve
* Learning from more senior developers
  ** Coding standards
  ** Relevancy of technique
  ** New ways of solving problems
* Real World experience during school years
  ** GSOC probably the largest example

=== Others ===

* Ideas you have we haven't discussed

== Growing the community ==

=== Make people feel welcome ===

No one wants to be somewhere they're not wanted

* Biggest part

* Be kind
  ** Should go without saying, unfortunately, not always the case
* Leave your ego at the door
  ** If you want your project to be more than just you, check your ego

=== Spreading the word ===

* Web site
  ** Hosted for free on GitHub, SourceForge  or other code repos
* Social networks
  ** Carve a space on G+ or twitter
* Word of mouth
  ** Part of the above, also email, blogs, etc.
* In short marketing

==== Examples ====

* http://www.seamframework.org
* http://www.arquillian.org
* http://www.jboss.org/jdf
* http://forge.jboss.org

=== Removing barriers of entry ===

==== DVSC ====

* Git
* hg
* GitHub
* BitBucket

==== Documentation ==== 

* For the project -- Can't grow a community if no one uses your project
  ** Getting started
  ** Use cases
* Contributing
  ** Source / documentation - conventions, style, tools
  ** Creating issues - expectations, location, notifications
* Localized if possible

==== Issue tracker ====

* JIRA
* GitHub / BitBucket tracker

* Workflow
  ** Easy to use
  ** VCS integration
* Labels
  ** Something denoting great starting places
  ** Specific parts, code, module, documentation, test, etc

=== Honestly and transparency ===

* These are corner stones of great projects
* Part of making people feel welcome

* Public meetings and notes
* Open Mailing lists / Forums

// Use Seam and Forge as examples

== Turning all These Users into Leaders ==

=== Three keys ===

==== Viewing others as what you want them to be ====

* If all you see your users as beta testers and documentation authors 
  that's all they every will be
* See all users as contributors, treat them that way -- as equals
  ** Some may not take the plunge but that's okay

* How you view your community largely dictates how you will treat them

====  Empowering people to get there ==== 

* Mostly the same as what it takes to attract people

* Don't be afraid to let go of some power, after all, you trust these people

====  Recognizing people ====

* People want to be recognized for a job well done
* Spotlights
* SWAG

==== Ask ====

* Ask people for ideas, feedback, other contributions

* You don't have all the answers
* Others' ideas could be great
* Brain storm as a group
