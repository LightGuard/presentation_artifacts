            I'd like to introduce John.
            He is an enterprise developer for a typical larger organization.
            His employer makes use of Java EE for the majority of their day-to-day business.

            Anyone here in a similar spot thinking "if only Java EE did ______"?
            That's a common concern, especially when you are having to interface with different systems.

          :markdown
            Fortunately Java EE already has a power mechanism out of the box that can help with this: Java Connector Architecture or JCA!
            It probably doesn't provide an interface directly out of the box for what you need to do, but we can extend Java EE.

            All JMS integrations use JCA, but it goes much farther than messages.

          :markdown
            John has made the decision to go with something simple.
            The handhelds out on the inventory floor can be synced up and then drop a CSV to the network share, that seems like a pretty simple solution.
            He wonders how best to be notified of an inventory drop.
            Should polling be used?
            Can Java listen to the filesystem?
