[.topic.intro]
== What I'm *not* talking about

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
I'm not talking about these aspects of CDI, they've been covered before.
People should already know about them. 
I'm happy to go into it more after the session should people like.
====

== Bits of CDI
[.scatter]
* JSR 299 - Java EE 6
* JSR 346 - Java EE 7 
* +@Inject+
* Scopes
* Alternatives
* Decorators
* Qualifiers

Portable Extensions

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
What *is* a portable extension?
Why are they called portable extensions?
Are they difficult?
====

== !

[.middle]
Extensions allow you to customize the platform for your individual needs.

== !

[.middle]
Saying they're portable allows them to work with any CDI implementation (Weld, OpenWebBeans, CanDI).

== !

[.statement]
Anatomy of a Portable Extension

== !

[.statement] 
Only *3* things

== !

What are they?

[.middle.incremental]
* beans.xml (optional in CDI 1.1)
* services file
* POJO observing one of the CDI lifecycle events

== !

[.statement] 
Okay, maybe only *2* :)

====
I mentioned about this thing called the life cycle, what is it?
How does it work with other parts of the server?

== How can DeltaSpike Help

[.statement]
{next-label} +
Apache DeltaSpike

== DeltaSpike cont

* What is it?
* How do I get it?
* http://deltaspike.org

== !

[.statement]
How can Apache DeltaSpike help?  

== !

* Source of examples from experts
* Default implementation for metadata classes
* Additional helpers

[.topic]
== Helpers

* BeanUtils
* HierarchyDiscovery
* Annotateds

[.topic]
== Metadata Helpers

* ImmutableBean wrappers
* Basic Context implementation
* AnnotatedInstanceProvider
* WrappingbeanBuilder

Testing

== !

[.statement]
Best way to test: image:arquillian_logo.png[link="http://www.arquillian.org"]

== !

Users of Arquillian:

* Apache DeltaSpike
* CDI TCK
* TomEE
* many, many others

== !

Arquillian allows you to test inside the actual container

*No mocks*, *stubs*, or *embedded container*

Deploy as much or as little of your application as needed

== !

[.statement]
Example

[.topic.ending]
== Recap

== !

[.statement]
Extensions allow you to customize the platform. 

== !

[.statement]
CDI has a rich set of observable lifecycle events making extensions possible.

== !

[.statement]
Apache DeltaSpike, besides having a vast set of extensions, contains many helpers for extension authors.

== !

[.statement]
Finish off with testing inside your container with Arquillian
