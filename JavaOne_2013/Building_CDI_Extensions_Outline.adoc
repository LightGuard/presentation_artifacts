= Building CDI Extensions Outline
Jason Porter
2013-09-24

== Purpose

This talk is aimed at teaching people how to create CDI extensions.
As a slight follow-up it will use and demonstrate some of the Apache DeltaSpike helpers for extension authors.
It will NOT cover basic ideas of CDI (Interceptors, Injection, Qualifiers, etc.).
Testing an extension with Arquillian will be mentioned and a brief overview given

== Progression

* Intro to technology
* What is a Portable Extension?
* Overview of life-cycle
* Life-cycle Deep dive
* Cover DeltaSpike extension author helps
* Q&A

== What I hope people take away from the talk

* Basics of the life-cycle
* How to create a Portable Extension
* How to test

== Outline

* Intro to technology
** Java EE 6 - JSR 299
** Java EE 7 - JSR 346
** What I won't be covering
* What is a Portable Extension?
** What is it in concept?
** Anatomy of a Portable Extension
*** beans.xml
*** services file
*** class which observes a lifecycle event
* Overview of life-cycle - graphic depicting the life-cycle
** Application Start
** Find Extensions
** BeforeBeanDiscovery
** Scan Archive
** ProcessAnnotatedType
** AfterTypeDiscovery (1.1)
** ProcessInjectionPoint
** ProcessInjectionTarget - Abort if definitions errors exist
** ProcessProducer
** ProcessBeanAttributes (1.1)
** ProcessBean
** ProcessObserverMethod
** AfterBeanDiscovery - Abort if errors exist
** AfterDeploymentValidation  - Abort if deployment errors exist
** Application Runs
** Application Shutdown started
** BeforeShutdown
** Application terminates
* Life-cycle Deep dive - Slide or two for each life cycle
** Cover each portion of the life-cycle
** What can be done at each stage
** Note changes in CDI 1.1
** Show example code from DeltaSpike
* Cover DeltaSpike extension author helps
** BeanBuilder (https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/blob/master/deltaspike/core/api/src/main/java/org/apache/deltaspike/core/util/bean/BeanBuilder.java)
** ImmutableBean*
** WrappingBeanBuilder (https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/blob/master/deltaspike/core/api/src/main/java/org/apache/deltaspike/core/util/bean/WrappingBeanBuilder.java)
** Context classes (https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/tree/master/deltaspike/core/api/src/main/java/org/apache/deltaspike/core/util/context)
** AnnotationInstanceProvider (https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/tree/master/deltaspike/core/api/src/main/java/org/apache/deltaspike/core/util/context)
** Annotateds (https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/commits/master/deltaspike/core/api/src/main/java/org/apache/deltaspike/core/util/Annotateds.java)
** BeanUtils (https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/blob/master/deltaspike/core/api/src/main/java/org/apache/deltaspike/core/util/BeanUtils.java) - Much is already taken care of in CDI 1.1
** HierarchyDiscovery (https://github.com/apache/deltaspike/blob/master/deltaspike/core/api/src/main/java/org/apache/deltaspike/core/util/HierarchyDiscovery.java)
** Basic implementations of the metadata types
* Q&A
